# Training Real world Data for Learning more about Applied Machine learning

   5 Basic Steps in applied Machine Learning
     * Exploratory Analysis -- First, "get to know" the data. This step should be quick, efficient, and decisive.
	 * Data Cleaning  -- Then, clean your data to avoid many common pitfalls. Better data beats fancier algorithms
	 * Feature Engineering -- Next, help your algorithms "focus" on what's important by creating new features.
	 * Algorithm Selection -- Choose the best, most appropriate algorithms without wasting your time.
	 * Model Training  -- Finally, train your models. This step is pretty formulaic once you've done the first 4.
